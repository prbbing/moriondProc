\maketitle\abstracts{The nature of dark matter (DM) is still a mystery. Many direct
and indirect search experiments are trying to solve this puzzle. The LHC offers
a unique opportunity at the high energy frontier, where DM particles
or related new particles may be produced. Both the CMS and ATLAS
collaborations have carried out comprehensive DM search programs,
providing critical missing pieces to the puzzle. In this article, recent exotic DM searches in CMS and ATLAS are summarized and a brief outlook is given.}

\section{Introduction}

The nature of DM remains a mystery and there are many Beyond Standard Model
(BSM) theories proposed to give an explanation. LHC~\cite{LHCRef} offers a
unique opportunity to search for dark matter (DM) and related new particles at
the high energy frontier. ATLAS~\cite{ATLASRef} and CMS~\cite{CMSRef} are the
two general-purpose detectors at the LHC that are capable of searching for new
particles using a rich set of experimental signatures. Both experiments have carried out
comprehensive dedicated DM search programs, primarily in the following
categories: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Mono-X Signature: DM candidates are produced in association with another detectable physics object (X). 
\item Resonance Signature: The mediator coupled to DM candidates is produced resonantly, decaying to SM particles.
\item Associated Production with Heavy Flavor Quarks: DM candidates are produced in association with heavy flavor quarks.
\item Supersymmetry (SUSY) Searches: The lightest supersymmetric particles (LSP) in certain SUSY models are DM candidates.
\item SM Higgs Portal: DM candidates are decay products of the Higgs boson, where the Higgs boson is produced via SM processes. 
\end{itemize}    

The full LHC Run 2 data brings higher
precision to inclusive DM searches such as the mono-jet, mono-$Z$ and
mono-Higgs searches. More final states are being explored with aid from
innovative analysis techniques, motivated by theories such as dark
Higgs~\cite{DarkH} and dark photon~\cite{DarkPh}. In the meantime, the
theoretical framework has also advanced in the past decade, taking the
experimental results into account. As a consequence, more models have thrived,
encouraging both CMS and ATLAS to provide more interpretations. In particular,
the 2HDM+a model~\cite{2HDM} is widely considered in recent searches.
Figure~\ref{fig:diagrams} shows the diagrams of the models mentioned above.

Recent results from both CMS and ATLAS will be summarized in the next section
followed by an outlook on the future DM search programs at the LHC. All
searches discussed in this article use full Run 2 dataset. 

\section{Dedicated search results}

\subsection{Mono-X searches}

Mono-jet search is the flagship analysis in the DM regime as its simple final
state covers a large range of the parameter space, sensitive to many different
models. The recent ATLAS mono-jet search~\cite{monojet} uses data collected by a missing transverse energy, $\et$\,
trigger. The events are required to have at least one energetic jet and not
have leptons or photons present. Signal regions are divided by $\et$\ and various control regions are constructed by allowing leptons. A simultaneous fit is performed in both the signal regions and control regions, and the resulting discriminant spectrum expected from the background is compared with the data to determine whether there are significant deviations in data. This is a common procedure adopted by all the searches discussed in this article.

Mono-$Z$ is also a very important inclusive search. The recent CMS mono-$Z$
search~\cite{monoz} considers the leptonic final state where the $Z$ boson
decays to either a pair of muons or electrons. Events are collected by di-muon
(di-electron) triggers and must contain two well-identified, isolated muons
(electrons) with the same flavor and opposite charge, forming an invariant mass
compatible with the $Z$ boson mass. Events with additional leptons, more than
one jet or any $b$-tagged jets are vetoed to suppress the backgrounds. Signal
regions are constructed based on either the missing transverse momentum,
$\ptmiss$, or the transverse mass between the di-lepton system and $\ptmiss$,
$\mt$. The latter one is optimized for 2HDM+a model as there is a peak in $\mt$
spectrum near the neutral scalar (H) mass.

Both the mono-jet and mono-$Z$ searches have data observation compatible with the background estimation, therefore up limits are set on specific models as the examples shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mono_jet_z}.

\label{fig:mono_jet_z}
\end{figure}

Both the mono-jet and mono-$Z$ search considers well known detectable standard
model (SM) physic objects. Searches considering less well known SM particles
such as the Higgs boson or new BSM particles such as a new scalar target the
specific phase space, facing different experimental challenges. The recent
ATLAS mono-Higgs($\rightarrow b\overline{b}$) search~\cite{monoh} analyzes
events collected by the primary $\et$\ triggers. Events are required to have
sizable $\et$\ and not contain isolated leptons. The signal regions are categorized by
the $b$-tagged multiplicity (two or three) and the collinearity of the two
$b$-tagged jets forming the Higgs candidate (merged and resolved). The ATLAS
mono-s($\rightarrow VV$) search~\cite{monos} probes a similar final state with
sizable $\et$\ but looks for hadronic boson decays instead of $b$-hadron
decays. Events must contain two boson tagged jets, and the signal regions are
categorized by their collinearity (merged and intermediate) as well. 

Data observation agrees well with the background expectation in both the mono-Higgs($\rightarrow b\overline{b}$) and mono-s($\rightarrow VV$) searches. Up limits are set on specific models as the examples shown in Figure~\ref{mono_h_s}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Dark photon search in the VBF channel}

As the most recently discovered SM particle, the Higgs boson opens up an
interesting avenue for DM search, not only because it can be produced in
association with DM particles but also it may decay to DM particles. The
Higgs$\rightarrow inv$) branching ratio is a critical channel to study the
phase space where $m_{i\textrm{DM}} < \frac{1}{2}m_{\textrm{H}}$. The combined
Higgs$\rightarrow inv$ branching ratio measurement~\cite{hiv} sets a stringent
upper limit of 0.11 at 95\% CL. Recent ATLAS~\cite{atlasvbf} and
CMS~\cite{cmsvbf} searches explore another unique scenario where the Higgs boson
decays to a dark photon and a photon, which gives sizable $\et$\ and a photon
in the final state. Both searches consider the VBF production channel given its
larger cross section, applying similar event selections such as containing VBF
jets and lepton veto. The $\mt$\ between the photon and the $\ptmiss$\ is used
as the discriminant variable to define the signal regions. 

No significant deviations are observed in neither searches and up limits are set on $\sigma_{\textrm{VBF}}\times B(H\rightarrow\gamma+inv)$ as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:vbf}.
It is worth mentioning that ATLAS applies a lower photon $p_{\textrm{T}}$ threshold and
additional jet centrality cuts, resulting in stronger exclusion limits.

\caption[]{Observed (solid) and expected (dashed) limits on $\sigma_{\textrm{VBF}}\times B(H\rightarrow\gamma+inv)$ obtained in the CMS~\cite{cmsvbf} (left) and ATLAS~\cite{atlasvbf} (right) search.}
\label{fig:vbf}
\end{figure}

\subsection{DM interpretations in SUSY searches}

R-parity conserving (RPC) SUSY predicts a stable LSP, which is a good DM candidate. SUSY searches targeting this
scenario usually requires large $\et$ and high jet ($b$-tagged jet)
multiplicity. Certain DM models may share similar final states. In a recent
ATLAS SUSY search~\cite{dmbb}, dedicated signal regions are constructed and
optimized for DM particles produced in association with a pair of $b$-quarks. Event selections include $\et$\, $b$-jet multiplicity and lepton veto. In addition, specialized variables are applied to optimize individual signal regions. The background prediction agrees well with the data, therefore up limits are set on the DM production cross section as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dmbb}.   

\begin{figure} [htb]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{DMBB}}
\caption[]{Observed (solid) and expected (dashed) limits on the DM cross section obtained in the ATLAS SUSY search~\cite{dmbb}.}

\end{figure}

\section{Conclusions}

LHC has explored a very large phase space where DM could have existed.
Recent theoretical development encourages searches to look at more specific
final states in addition to the inclusive ones and several new results from
both CMS and ATLAS already extended the scope of the DM search program to new
horizons. There are still many ongoing full Run 2 DM searches that will further
broaden the coverage. Both experiments have learned great lessons and will be better prepared for Run 3. More dedicated triggers and reconstruction technologies are being developed to improve the search sensitivities. The hunt is still on!
